### Determining The Main Mobility Flows in the City of Lisbon Based on Mobile Device Data

#### World Data League Project
From 1980s-2017, the population of the city of Lisbon decreased from 800.000 to 500.000 to its metropolitan area - this has lead to increased car use in daily commuting between the city and the metropolitan area, overloading of the road network, coupled with decrease in public transport. 

The Lisbon City Council's objectives for the 2023-2027 period include boosting soft mobility modes, making it easier and more affordable use of public transportation, and promoting the development of an integrated, connected, accessible, multimodal ecosystem.

Our team helped with the strategic planning towards a city with "Smooth Traffic Flow". To this end, we developed a deep-learning-based forecasting model to support the mobility policies for the city of Lisbon by predicting futures trends on mobility flow at particular areas in the city and clustering these areas by impact levels. We have produced a model and product plan that can help users themselves identify inefficient routes and when to consider alternative routes/modes of transport. People in Lisbon need alternatives, and they need ones that are reliable and easily accessible.

The output of this project led to us being ranked 5th place amonst 29 other teams.
